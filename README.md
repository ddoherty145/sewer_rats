Hi everyone, my project is called 'Sewer Rats,' and it's a work-in-progress game inspired by Vampire Survivors.

For those unfamiliar, Vampire Survivors is an arcade game where you face endless waves of enemies. A key feature is that many of your items and weapons attack automatically, allowing for dynamic and chaotic gameplay.

I'm developing Sewer Rats using Python and Pygame, building upon the skills I learned in our previous semester.

While the core game logic seems to be working correctly based on the terminal output, the visual presentation is currently quite rough. Adding sprites significantly increased the project's complexity, making it harder to track and debug. In hindsight, I might have explored using a dedicated game engine for better visual control.

There are several areas I'd like to improve with more time:

**Enemy AI:** In Vampire Survivors, enemies actively pursue the player. I'm currently struggling to implement smooth enemy movement and consistent on-screen display.
**Weapon Upgrades:** I planned to incorporate a system where picking up the same weapon multiple times would increase its power, but I haven't been able to implement this yet.
**Animations:** Adding visual effects and animations would greatly enhance the player experience, but I haven't had the time to focus on them.
Despite these challenges, I'm learning a lot through this project, and I'm eager to continue refining Sewer Rats in the future.

**To-Run:**
